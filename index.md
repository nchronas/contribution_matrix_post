## Welcome to GitHub Pages


Paris Chrysos has made an interesting analysis of the contribution of each member for UPSat's developement, by analysing the team's git flow.

The collaboration matrix, a visualisation of the commits per feature and developer has revealed an interesting pattern about my role and the overall organisation of the team. Most of the developers focus in a single subsystem (EPS, COMMS, ADCS, OBC) while me and Apostolos Masiakos work on the TT&C software, that integrates all subsystem functionality. Through the use of the TT&C that connects we achieve code reusability and shortening testing time.
